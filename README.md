It deleats the data of text file and re writes something
This is a Python code v3 and if python3 is installed in your computer then just double click the .py file

You can only experience this if you create a text file in the same directory as in which the .py file is present
It can be harm ful a slight change in code can delete all the text files in your hard disk

I am not responsible for any loss of data
